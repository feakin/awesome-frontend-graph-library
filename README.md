Others:

- [Alchemy](https://github.com/GraphAlchemist/Alchemy)  is a graph drawing application built in d3. Alchemy.js was built so that developers could easily get up and running with Graph visualization applications, and not much over head. 

## Layout Algorithm

- [cola.js](https://github.com/tgdwyer/WebCola) JavaScript constraint based layout for high-quality graph visualization and exploration using D3.js and other web-based graphics libraries.
- [ELK](https://github.com/kieler/elkjs)  Eclipse Layout Kernel (ELK) implements an infrastructure to connect diagram editors or viewers to automatic layout algorithms. This library takes the layout-relevant part of ELK and makes it available to the JavaScript world. 
	- [KLayJS](https://github.com/kieler/klayjs) is a layer-based layout algorithm that is particularly suited for node-link diagrams with an inherent direction and ports (explicit attachment points on a node's border). 
- [Dracula](https://github.com/strathausen/dracula) is a set of tools to display and layout interactive graphs, along with various related algorithms.
- [dagre](https://github.com/dagrejs/dagre) is a JavaScript library that makes it easy to lay out directed graphs on the client-side.
- [Springy](https://github.com/dhotson/springy) is a force directed graph layout algorithm in JavaScript.
- [ngraph](https://github.com/anvaka/ngraph) is a set of graph related algorithms. It can be used in a browser or on the server side. This repository is a collection of examples, which show how to use some of them or build your own.

Cytoscape.js related:

 - [cytoscape.js-cise](https://github.com/iVis-at-Bilkent/cytoscape.js-cise) iSE(Circular Spring Embedder) is an algorithm based on the traditional force-directed layout scheme with extensions to move and rotate nodes in the same cluster as a group. 
 - [SyBLaRS](https://github.com/iVis-at-Bilkent/syblars) Systems Biology Layout & Rendering Service (SyBLaRS) is a web service to lay out graphs in SBGNML, SBML, GraphML and JSON formats and/or produce corresponding images (in JPG, PNG or SVG formats) of the layouts with an option to highlight results from various graph queries in the backend.
 - [avsdf](https://github.com/iVis-at-Bilkent/cytoscape.js-avsdf) An implementation of the Circular Drawing Algorithm by Hongmei He & Ondrej SÃ½kora.
 - [fcose](https://github.com/iVis-at-Bilkent/cytoscape.js-fcose) is a faster version of our earlier compound spring embedder algorithm named CoSE, implemented as a Cytoscape.js extension by i-Vis Lab in Bilkent University.

D3.js realted:

- [D3 Force](https://github.com/d3/d3-force)  Force-directed graph layout using velocity Verlet integration. 
	- [cytoscape-d3-force](https://github.com/shichuanpo/cytoscape.js-d3-force)  d3-force for cytoscape 

Framework related: 

- [vis-network](https://github.com/visjs/vis-network)  is a visualization to display networks and networks consisting of nodes and edges. The visualization is easy to use and supports custom shapes, styles, colors, sizes, images, and more. 


## Render Styled

- [Rough](https://github.com/rough-stuff/rough) is a small (<9 kB) graphics library that lets you draw in a sketchy, hand-drawn-like, style. The library defines primitives to draw lines, curves, arcs, polygons, circles, and ellipses. It also supports drawing SVG paths.

## Render 

- [Konvajs](https://github.com/konvajs) is an HTML5 Canvas JavaScript framework that extends the 2d context by enabling canvas interactivity for desktop and mobile applications.
	- [react-konva](https://github.com/konvajs/react-konva) JavaScript library for drawing complex canvas graphics using React.
- [Raphael](https://github.com/DmitryBaranovskiy/raphael)  Cross-browser vector graphics the easy way.

## Model

- [https://github.com/graphology/graphology](https://github.com/graphology/graphology) is a robust & multipurpose Graph object for JavaScript and TypeScript.

Cinco:

- [Cinco](https://gitlab.com/scce/cinco-cloud) Cinco SCCE Meta Tooling Framework.

[Meta Graph Language](https://gitlab.com/scce/cinco/-/wikis/Usage/Meta-Graph-Language), The root element of every mgl file is the MGL model object. It can contain several model elements like graphmodels, nodes, edges, and more. Beside of that, it also contains some mandatory meta data that will be considered upon generation.


## Geometric Algebra
