# Awesome Graph Library

> collection for Feakin only. inspired by: [https://github.com/anvaka/graph-drawing-libraries](https://github.com/anvaka/graph-drawing-libraries)

## Graph App

- [Drawio](https://github.com/jgraph/drawio) this project, is a configurable diagramming/whiteboarding visualization application. draw.io is owned and developed by JGraph Ltd, a UK based software company.
- [Excalidraw](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw)  Virtual whiteboard for sketching hand-drawn like diagrams.

## Graph Drawing Library

- [MaxGraph](https://github.com/maxGraph/maxGraph) is a TypeScript library which can display and allow interaction with vector diagrams. 
- [VivaGraph](https://github.com/anvaka/VivaGraphJS)is designed to be extensible and to support different rendering engines and layout algorithms. Underlying algorithms have been broken out into ngraph.
- [Sigma.js](https://github.com/jacomyal/sigma.js) is an open-source JavaScript library aimed at visualizing graphs of thousands of nodes and edges.

Others:

- [Alchemy](https://github.com/GraphAlchemist/Alchemy)  is a graph drawing application built in d3. Alchemy.js was built so that developers could easily get up and running with Graph visualization applications, and not much over head. 

## Layout Algorithm

- [cola.js](https://github.com/tgdwyer/WebCola) JavaScript constraint based layout for high-quality graph visualization and exploration using D3.js and other web-based graphics libraries.
- [ELK](https://github.com/kieler/elkjs)  Eclipse Layout Kernel (ELK) implements an infrastructure to connect diagram editors or viewers to automatic layout algorithms. This library takes the layout-relevant part of ELK and makes it available to the JavaScript world. 
	- [KLayJS](https://github.com/kieler/klayjs) is a layer-based layout algorithm that is particularly suited for node-link diagrams with an inherent direction and ports (explicit attachment points on a node's border). 
- [Dracula](https://github.com/strathausen/dracula) is a set of tools to display and layout interactive graphs, along with various related algorithms.
- [dagre](https://github.com/dagrejs/dagre) is a JavaScript library that makes it easy to lay out directed graphs on the client-side.
- [Springy](https://github.com/dhotson/springy) is a force directed graph layout algorithm in JavaScript.
- [ngraph](https://github.com/anvaka/ngraph) is a set of graph related algorithms. It can be used in a browser or on the server side. This repository is a collection of examples, which show how to use some of them or build your own.

Cytoscape.js related:

 - [cytoscape.js-cise](https://github.com/iVis-at-Bilkent/cytoscape.js-cise) iSE(Circular Spring Embedder) is an algorithm based on the traditional force-directed layout scheme with extensions to move and rotate nodes in the same cluster as a group. 
 - [SyBLaRS](https://github.com/iVis-at-Bilkent/syblars) Systems Biology Layout & Rendering Service (SyBLaRS) is a web service to lay out graphs in SBGNML, SBML, GraphML and JSON formats and/or produce corresponding images (in JPG, PNG or SVG formats) of the layouts with an option to highlight results from various graph queries in the backend.
 - [avsdf](https://github.com/iVis-at-Bilkent/cytoscape.js-avsdf) An implementation of the Circular Drawing Algorithm by Hongmei He & Ondrej SÃ½kora.
 - [fcose](https://github.com/iVis-at-Bilkent/cytoscape.js-fcose) is a faster version of our earlier compound spring embedder algorithm named CoSE, implemented as a Cytoscape.js extension by i-Vis Lab in Bilkent University.

D3.js realted:

- [D3 Force](https://github.com/d3/d3-force)  Force-directed graph layout using velocity Verlet integration. 
	- [cytoscape-d3-force](https://github.com/shichuanpo/cytoscape.js-d3-force)  d3-force for cytoscape 

Framework related: 

- [vis-network](https://github.com/visjs/vis-network)  is a visualization to display networks and networks consisting of nodes and edges. The visualization is easy to use and supports custom shapes, styles, colors, sizes, images, and more. 


## Render 

- [Konvajs](https://github.com/konvajs) is an HTML5 Canvas JavaScript framework that extends the 2d context by enabling canvas interactivity for desktop and mobile applications.
	- [react-konva](https://github.com/konvajs/react-konva) JavaScript library for drawing complex canvas graphics using React.


## Model

- [https://github.com/graphology/graphology](https://github.com/graphology/graphology) is a robust & multipurpose Graph object for JavaScript and TypeScript.
